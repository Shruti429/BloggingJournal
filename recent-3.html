    <h1>How to unlearn.. after tasting massive wins?</h1>
    <img class="travel-image" src="images/recent-3.jpg" alt="">
    <p>Pretty much all the important roles in an organization fall for confirmation bias, that is *I know-it-all* bias, and ‘this-is-how-it-works’ bias.</p>
    <p>For example, if you have had a very successful run with the launch of a product, the chances are that you will be 100% confident that the next product launch will be super hits (in fact much better than the previous ones).</p>
    <p>Why? Because you know how-it-works. How the system works. You know the taste of the audience. You know how to do PR. You know how to create the right noise.</p>
    <p>Well, at least you think so.</p>
    <p>By the way, remember Nokia? Blackberry? Ouch…. Let’s move on.</p>
    <p>How does one stay open to new ideas, then?</p>
    <p>Practically speaking, most successful managers/leaders end up surrounding themselves with yes-(wo)men and that just adds very significantly to the *I-am-inevitable* syndrome.</p>
    <p>The simplest way to keep learning new ideas is to surround yourself with people who are talking and implementing new ideas.</p>
    <p>If you are always the smartest person in the room (i.e. talking and dispersing gyaan), you are definitely not learning. Some of the amazing leaders I know are often attending random Clubhouse events to Zoom webinars to learn and get more perspective from others.

        Learn to be an audience. And a great one at it. The first step towards being curious is to become a true learner.</p>
    <h2>Set yourself up for failure (outside work.. to start with) !</h2>
    <p>Of course, I won’t recommend trying out this in your core job – but try to set yourself up for failure outside your work.</p>
    <p>For instance, start writing if you aren’t doing so. It not only improves your clarity and gets better at work (read: Why Product managers should write). But if writing is not your thing, start a TikTok channel or a podcast or whatever – that keeps you in front of an audience and opens yourself to be judged (and laughed upon).</p>
